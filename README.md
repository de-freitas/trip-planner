# **trip-planner**!

### **About:**

"trip-planner" is a web application created to help you plan trips. It allows you to create a trip, invite friends, and build a detailed itinerary. You can add important links, such as hotel reservations and flights, and manage participants. The project was developed during NextLevelWeek, promoted by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/), which consists of an immersion with three free classes and lots of content. Initially, the application was built using ReactJS with TypeScript and Tailwind, specifically with Vite. Soon after, I migrated the application to Next.js.
